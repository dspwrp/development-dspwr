Please see the descriptions of both Programs on this site. In general, both programs focus on research in humans, including human tissues. Animal model studies are only considered if the research is directly applicable to humans, not yet feasible in humans, but is expected to become feasible in humans immediately after the animal model study is completed.&nbsp; </span></p> <p><strong><em>Neuroimaging Program</em></strong> studies currently utilize structural, physiological or cellular/molecular imaging techniques, or combinations of these, and tend to focus on: 1) understanding normal brain functioning, how this is altered by disease or injury (identifying biomarkers), and how the brain recovers or repairs; 2) assessing and improving diagnostic approaches and measuring the effectiveness of experimental therapies; and 3) refining and advancing imaging technologies to address specific clinical questions.&nbsp; For degenerative diseases, studies also examine developmental processes of disease, surrogate measures of early disease existence, and measures of disease progression.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>The Clinical Neuroscience Research program</em></strong> tends to focus on: 1) translating promising animal model interventions or clinical observations for treating devastating brain conditions or injuries into small-sale studies in humans with these conditions to see if the intervention shows any effect, and designing neuroethical guidelines for such studies; 2) identifying functions of specific neurons and neural networks involved in brain diseases or injuries and developing therapeutic interventions to alter these; and 3) assessing outcomes of the effects of various therapies used to treat brain injuries, such as stroke. The program also occasionally considers studies of complex cognitive processes, such as creativity.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong></p> <hr> <em>How can I learn more about each of these programs?</em><p><span>Please see descriptions on </span><a href="http://www.dana.org/Grants/"><span>our website</span></a><span> and look at </span><a href="http://www.dana.org/GrantsLanding/"><span>specific studies that have been funded</span></a><span> in the past for a general view of the kinds of research provided under each program.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong></p> <hr> <p><em>How do I know under which program my research would best fit?</em></p> <p><span>Please visit the pages for each program and read the </span><a href="http://www.dana.org/Grants/"><span>descriptions</span></a><span>. For additional guidance, please view the </span><a href="http://www.dana.org/GrantsLanding/"><span>descriptions of studies already funded</span></a><span> in each program.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong>&nbsp;<span></span></p> <hr> <p><em>Does the Foundation provide funding to individual scientists?</em></p> <p><span>No, the Foundation provides no grants to individuals. Grants are provided to medical schools, research institutions, and other 501(c)(3) organizations to support scientists' research.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p> <hr> <p><em>Does the Foundation fund for-profit institutions?</em></p> <p><span>No, the Foundation only funds Not-for-Profit organizations.</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong>&nbsp;<span></span></p> <hr> <em>Does the Foundation fund science education grants? </em><p>Rarely, and only by invitation. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong></p> <hr> <em>Can an NIH scientist apply for a Dana Foundation grant?</em><p><span>On Neuroimaging and Clinical Neuroscience Research grants, NIH scientists can be collaborators (co-PIs or co-investigators) on grant applications submitted by a PI from U.S. medical schools or free-standing research institutes. The grant is awarded to the PI’s institution, not to the NIH.&nbsp; The NIH receives a subcontract from the PI’s institution.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong></p> <hr> <em>How do I arrange to meet with a representative of the Dana Foundation?</em><p><span>Meetings with the Foundation staff are by invitation only.</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong>&nbsp;<span></span></p> <hr> <p><em><span>Who may apply to the Neuroimaging program and why is it generally limited to new or newly independent investigators?</span></em></p> <p><span>The Neuroimaging program is designed to support early promising career investigators. Therefore, support is focused on faculty researchers who have demonstrated the potential for independent research careers who are at the assistant professor level, or in the first few years of their associate professor appointments. Post-doctoral fellows are not eligible to apply unless they will have a faculty appointment at the time that the grant would be awarded.&nbsp; <em>(See post-doctoral eligibility question below.)</em> Applications from junior investigators that are an extension of the work of a senior mentor, particularly if from the same institution, are discouraged.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <hr> <em>In the Clinical Neuroscience Research Program, are clinical researchers at any stage in their careers eligible, or are there restrictions concerning either junior or senior investigators?&nbsp;</em><p><span>The Clinical Neuroscience Research program invites junior and senior level investigators. Post-doctoral fellows are not eligible to apply.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <hr> <em>Does the Foundation support basic research?</em><p><span>No. The Clinical Neuroscience Research program focuses on human research. The Neuroimaging program focuses on patient-oriented studies (research with patients or patient tissues) and on brain functioning in health and how functions are altered by diseases and injuries.&nbsp; Research that does not involve patients or patient tissues is supported only when the investigation is directly applicable to human health and functioning, is not yet feasible in humans, but is expected to become feasible in humans immediately after the animal model study is completed.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <hr> <em>I know that Dana emphasizes research in humans or on human tissue, but what if I have an animal model study that is applicable to humans but not yet feasible to be undertaken in humans? Can I apply under the Neuroimaging Program or the Clinical Neuroscience Research program?</em><p><span>The Neuroimaging and Clinical Neuroscience Research programs focus on research in humans, including human tissues. If research is directly related to human health, not yet feasible to be undertaken in humans, but is anticipated to be ready for human studies immediately following completion of the animal model study, the study could be considered. The Foundation’s guidelines as outlined under the Neuroimaging program are as follows:</span></p> <p><span>“Applications for animal model studies of brain conditions or injuries will be considered only if they relate directly to the human but cannot yet feasibly be undertaken in humans, and are anticipated to be translated into the human following the three-year grant period. Such studies that are not undertaken in humans but directly relate to the human include research on: 1) normal brain anatomy and physiology in the animal model that can help to better understand the roles of cells and networks in specific cognitive functions and how these are altered by disease and injury; and 2) animal models of human diseases, either through insertion of human genes or through naturally occurring or induced disease states that are directly related to the human condition.”</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p> <hr> <em>Am I allowed to apply for Neuroscience grants designated invitation-only?

But because grants are made to institutions and not to individuals, applicants in institutions without tenure track systems should describe their appointments and their Institution’s commitment to them during the period of the proposed grant. This applies to both Neuroimaging and Clinical Neuroscience Research program applicants.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong></p> <hr> <p><em>Can applicants apply to the David Mahoney Neuroimaging program or the Clinical Neuroscience Research program if they have faculty appointments but do not have tenure or are not on a tenure track?</em></p> <p><span>Yes. Institutions vary in their tenure situations and decisions. Applicants will need, however, to describe their appointments and their institution’s commitment to them during the period of the proposed grant. This applies to both Neuroimaging and Clinical Neuroscience Research program applicants.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong></p> <hr> <em>What happens if an applicant only has a one-year, potentially renewable appointment?</em><p><span>Since grants are awarded to institutions and not individuals, institutions should put forward candidates that have an institutional commitment for the full grant period. This commitment is especially significant for Neuroimaging applicants, since grants are intended to assist promising early-career investigators. Therefore, reviewers place significant weight on the investigator’s career trajectory. Applicants with limited appointments are at a competitive disadvantage, and institutions should carefully consider the advisability of selecting such applicants. If an institution decides to put forward a candidate for a Neuroimaging grant who is on an annual appointment track, the candidate will be eligible only if he or she submits a written letter from the department chair stating that the applicant’s appointment will be renewed through the grant period.</span></p> <p><strong><a href="#BTT">Back to Top ^</a></strong></p> <hr> <a name="nih"></a><strong>NIH GRANTS AND PREVIOUS RO1’s</strong><p><em><span>What if I am not yet a professor but have two RO1’s and the research for which I want to apply to Dana is not related to the areas of research covered by my existing R01 grants.

Could I apply for a second Neuroimaging grant?</em><p><span>Generally, the Foundation does not provide a second grant for investigators, since grants are intended to enable investigators to develop preliminary data that will increase their competitiveness for larger-scale grants from other sources. Occasionally, however, the Foundation does award a second grant for an investigator. For Neuroimaging grants, you would not be able to apply until the first grant is completed.
