In early March, he was hit by a delivery truck at a pedestrian crossing while returning home from work at the Cracow Institute of Pharmacology. He never regained consciousness. Polish Neuroscience is in mourning, as we lost an extraordinary person.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jerzy was a neuropharmacologist and author of hundreds of papers. His most important contribution was the hypothesis of beta-downregulation as a mechanism of action of antidepressants. Although he was one of the most cited polish neuroscientists, it was not his science that made him special. It was the way he talked about science.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jerzy gave lectures on neuroscience to students and lay audiences in an incredible way, both informative and funny, with insights into philosophy, literature, history and politics. He had the ability to describe complicated brain processes in a clear and attractive way. He made the audience think about the most important issues – morality, empathy, aggression, beauty, creativity, love, and sexuality. He had a blog entitled “<a href="https://vetulani.wordpress.com/" title="The Beauty of Neurobiology">The Beauty of Neurobiology</a>” and published several popular books about the brain and neuroscience. For Brain Awareness Week this March, he had 27 scheduled invited talks. They never happened.

His research was invaluable to the study of neuromuscular disorders.<strong><br><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-04/uoo-ubl041316.php" title="Paul Matthews Will Chair UK Biobank Imaging Expert Working Group"><br>Paul Matthews Will Chair UK Biobank Imaging Expert Working Group</a><br></strong>The UK Biobank recently launched the world's largest body scanning project. Funded by the Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust, and the British Heart Foundation, it will study images of the brain, heart, bones, carotid arteries, and abdominal fat of 100,000 Britons. EDAB member <strong>Paul Matthews</strong>, head of brain sciences at Imperial College, London, will chair the Imaging Expert Working Group, a team of academics who will help create the resource.<strong><br><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/brain-scans-reveal-how-lsd-affects-consciousness-1.19727" title="David Nutt Interviewed about LSD Research"><br>David Nutt Publishes First Images of the Brain on LSD</a><br></strong>Alliance member <strong>David Nutt</strong> of Imperial College London was interviewed by Nature about his new research on LSD and the brain.
