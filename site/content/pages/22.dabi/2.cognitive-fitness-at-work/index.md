<div class="item"><h2><a href="/About/Programs/Cognitive_Fitness_Initiative/" title="Cognitive Fitness Initiative">Cognitive Fitness at&nbsp; Work</a></h2> For the Cognitive Fitness Initiative the Alliance develops programs and resources focused on the factors that may contribute to a brain healthy lifestyle throughout adulthood. The Your Brain at Work series, part of the Initiative, explores brain science issues that relate to the mature worker, offering information about what employees can do to maintain cognitive fitness and how their employers can assist. The Dana Alliance partnered with The Conference Board to create this series, in order to raise awareness among both workers and employers of the benefits of brain fitness. <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div> </div>
