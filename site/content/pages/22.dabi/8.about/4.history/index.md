Watson, Ph.D., Director of the Laboratory and Nobel laureate for his codiscovery of the structure of DNA, and the late David Mahoney, Chairman of the Dana Foundation. Their vision was to establish a group of vanguard neuroscientists who would commit themselves to translating the advances in brain research to the public, the ultimate beneficiary of these advances.</p> <p>The assembled scientists debated how best to communicate the promise of neuroscience to the public in a way that would convey their knowledge and excitement.&nbsp; They were particularly convened about&nbsp;recent decreases in federal funding for neuroscience research at the very time such research was beginning to yield breakthrough treatments for some of the most devastating neurological disorders.</p> <p><img align="left" class="imageLeft" style="margin-right: 4px; margin-left: 4px;" alt="" src="/uploadedImages/Images/Feature_Images/thumb_DavidMahoney_feat.jpg" data-ektron-style="margin-right: 4px; margin-left: 4px;">"People want to know what you can do for them," Mahoney (left) told the neuroscientists.&nbsp; "They want results that can benefit them."&nbsp; Only by convincing the public of the direct benefits of their work, Mahoney cautioned them, could they hope to receive the funding, public and private, that would speed vital work.</p> <p>By the end of the Cold Spring Harbor meeting, the group had vowed to change the landscape of public support for brain research.&nbsp; They developed&nbsp;a "Declaration of Objectives" setting forth 10 research goals that were both meaningful to the public&nbsp;and&nbsp;considered achievable by the end of the 1990's.&nbsp; These goals guided the Alliance's activities of the next several years.&nbsp;</p> <p>1.&nbsp; The identification of the genes that are defective in familial Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases.</p> <p>2.&nbsp; The identification of the genes responsible for manic-depressive illness.</p> <p>3.&nbsp; The development of new medications and therapeutic strategies to reduce nerve cell death and enhance recovery of function after strokes and other forms of brain injury.</p> <p>4.&nbsp; The development of new drugs and other measures to alleviate the effects of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease), Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy.</p> <p>5.&nbsp; The identification&nbsp;of new treatments to promote nerve regeneration following spinal cord and peripheral nerve injury.</p> <p>6.&nbsp; The development of new and more effective treatments for manic-depressive illness, anxiety disorders, and forms of schizophrenia that at present resist treatment.</p> <p>7.&nbsp; The discovery, testing, and application of agents that will block the action of cocaine and other addictive substances.</p> <p>8.&nbsp; The development of new treatments for pain associated with cancer, arthritis, migraine headaches, and other debilitating diseases.</p> <p>9.&nbsp; The identification of the genes that cause hereditary deafness and blindness.</p> <p>10.&nbsp; The elucidating of the neuronal mechanisms involved in learning and memory.</p> <h2>A Global Force in Brain Research Advocacy</h2> <p>From those founding members, the Dana Alliance has grown to include more than&nbsp;<span><a title="Dana-Alliance-Members-February2018" href="/uploadedFiles/Pdfs/Dana-Alliance-Members-July2018.pdf">580 members</a></span>, including 15 Nobel laureates.&nbsp; Its members, all leaders in their field, represent a broad range of neuroscience disciplines, including neurology, neurobiology, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimmunology, and virtually every subspecialty within neuroscience.&nbsp; Today, the Alliance is considered one of the most effective and respected forces in communicating science.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1997, leading scientific colleagues in Europe sought to make the mission global.&nbsp; After discussions in Europe with Mr. Mahoney and Dana director William Safire, the&nbsp;<a title="European Dana Alliance for the Brain" href="http://www.dana.org/About/EDAB/" target="_blank">European Dana Alliance for the Brain</a>&nbsp;(EDAB) was created.&nbsp; EDAB's active membership has taken the message about the promise of brain research worldwide, firmly establishing that organization as another important international force in advocacy for brain science.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </div>
