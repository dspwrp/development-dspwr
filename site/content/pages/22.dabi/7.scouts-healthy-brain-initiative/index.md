Scouts Healthy Brain Initiative
The Healthy Brain Initiative is a free online resource on the brain and brain health to help Scout Leaders create programs for their scouts. At dana.org/scouts there is a leader's guide with instructions on content for the program, ideas, how-to tips and supply lists for activities/experiments and downloadable materials to distribute. The program hopes to encourage brain healthy lifestyles as well as encourage the development of future neuroscientists.
