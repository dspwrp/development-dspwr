BAW unites the efforts of partner organizations from around the world in a week-long celebration of the brain every March.</p> <p>During BAW, partners organize fun and fascinating events in their communities to educate and excite people of all ages about the brain and the promise of brain research.<br><strong></strong>&nbsp;<br>BAW was founded by the <a href="http://www.dana.org/About/DABI/">Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives</a> (DABI) and the <a href="http://www.dana.org/About/EDAB/">European Dana Alliance for the Brain</a> (EDAB), and is coordinated by <a href="http://www.dana.org/">The Dana Foundation</a>.</p> <p><strong>When and why did BAW start?</strong><br> BAW began in 1996 as a modest effort involving just 160 organizations in the United States. DABI organized the first BAW to bring together diverse groups with different interests from academia, government, and professional and advocacy organizations. The goal was to unite them with the common theme that brain research is the hope for treatments, preventions, and possible cures for brain diseases and disorders and to ensure a better quality of life at all ages. </p> <p>In the 23 years since its founding, BAW has evolved into a global education initiative that has included the participation of more than 5,600 partners in 120 countries. During the 2018 campaign alone, more than 895 BAW events were held in 42 countries and 44 states. <span>&nbsp;</span><span></span></p> <p><strong>Who participates?</strong><br> BAW partners include universities and colleges, hospitals, K-12 schools, advocacy groups, outreach and educational organizations, medical research facilities, professional organizations, senior centers, libraries, government agencies, corporations, and more.
