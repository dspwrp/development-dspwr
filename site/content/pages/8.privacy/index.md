If you do not want us to know your identity or anything about your interests, you remain welcome to the information available onscreen on the Dana site.</p> <p>What if you wish to request free Dana publications in hard-copy form, or want us to send information to you by mail or e-mail? When you voluntarily make such requests and send us your name and address, the only use we make of that information about you is to respond to your request.</p> <p>If you choose to sign up to participate in an online survey, you are assured that your voluntary identification will not be shared for any marketing purpose.</p> <p>We do use mailing houses and third party e-mail automation services for distribution of our publications, but we insist these mailing houses and third parties agree not to use our lists for any secondary purpose. Dana does not sell, lend or rent or give your name and address or any other personally identifiable information about you to anyone. If you supply us with any information, you may direct us to delete it at any time.</p> <p><strong>What about "cookies"?</strong> “Cookies” are the electronic observers sent by a Web server to store on your computer. They contain&nbsp;information about you so that others can track your interests or remember your instructions. Because many people believe these devices can be a threat to their privacy, we are very careful and limited in the use of cookies.&nbsp; Dana only uses a session cookie to authenticate visitors who choose to register to subscribe to Dana publications and/or comment on articles. In addition, if a visitor selects a larger font size on articles, a session cookie is used to preserve that choice on subsequent pages.&nbsp; Except in these limited cases, which are initiated voluntarily by the visitor, Dana does not use cookies on any other areas of the site. To learn how often our site is being visited and what pages our audience finds most useful, we review Internet Protocol addresses in the aggregate that are not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual or family.</p> <p>Please be aware that our site contains links to many other sites that may not be as stringent as Dana is about guarding your identity. We cannot be responsible for their practices. When you leave our site to link to another, we urge you to examine the stated policy of every other site for assurance that no personally identifiable information about you can be collected or shared without your consent.</p> <p>We urge parents to tell their children to never give out names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet.</p> <p>Ours is the most privacy-protective policy we can devise while retaining the ability to respond to your requests. If you have questions about it, or suggestions to further protect visitors like you, please contact us (anonymously or otherwise) at <a href="mailto:privacy@dana.org">privacy@dana.org</a>. If we want to use the information you have given us in a different way, we will contact you by e-mail and ask permission first.</p> <h3>Our Guiding Privacy Principles:</h3> <ol> <li>You have the right to remain anonymous.</li> <li>You can rest assured that Dana will do nothing with information you send us beyond its specific purpose without your consent.</li> </ol> <div><p><strong><span>European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) Supplemental Privacy Policy</span></strong></p> <p><span>The Dana Foundation has developed a supplemental Privacy Policy to address the requirements of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
