list_description: 'Human enhancement embraces the idea that science and technology can be used to restore or expand cognitive and physical human capacities. It has received considerable public attention lately with the return of injured soldiers and the demand for prosthetic devices and with controversies surrounding the use of performance enhancing drugs. These and other topics were covered in a public event on September 19, 2013 in Washington, DC, sponsored by the AAAS and the Dana Foundation.'
