list_description: 'Neuroseries even in Washington, DC: Unlike most disabling physical illnesses, mental illness begins very early in life, with half of all lifetime cases beginning by age 14. Advances in neuroscience and related fields have produced evidence-based treatment options, but there remain serious gaps in access by those most in need across all ages. This event focused on what we know about the causes, effects and treatments of mental illness, from young children, to adolescents, to middle-age and elderly patients. Speakers: Mark S. Frankel, Nelson B. Freimer, Anne Marie Albano, and Colleen L. Barry. This event was part of the Neuroscience and Society series, supported by AAAS and the Dana Foundation.'
