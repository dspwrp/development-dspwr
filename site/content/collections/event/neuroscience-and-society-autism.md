list_description: 'Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which there is a major unmet therapeutic need.  Limited success from current translational models and amyloid-centric clinical trials highlight the need for broader therapeutic strategies.  Looking beyond amyloid and tau as direct avenues to modify AD pathology, the field has turned to a growing body of genetic and human biology evidence that supports a role for the innate immune system as a key modifier of AD risk and progression. This one-day symposium will present recent developments in our understanding of how innate immune processes, such as those controlled by CNS-resident microglia, impact the pathobiology of AD.  Moreover, the program will explore the dynamic mechanisms at the intersection of neurology and immunology that have emerged as ‘omics technologies have supplanted classical views of neuro-inflammation, with the goal of targeting the innate immune system in the CNS for next-generation AD therapeutics.'
