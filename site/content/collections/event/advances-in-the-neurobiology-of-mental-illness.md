list_description: 'This symposium will bring together scientists, clinicians, other healthcare professionals, and policy makers across academia, industry, and government sectors to discuss the latest advances in understanding the underlying neurobiology of mental illness ­— including epigenetic, molecular, and neuroimmunological mechanisms. Speakers will discuss research on topics such as molecular overlap in brain disorders, stigma, the neuroimmunology of mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal behavior, and bipolar disorder. In addition to exploring the basic science underlying these illnesses, the symposium will also focus on the translations of these findings into improved pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, and other interventions for mental health.'
