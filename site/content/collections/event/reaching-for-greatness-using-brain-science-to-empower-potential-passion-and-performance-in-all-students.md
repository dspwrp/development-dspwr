list_description: 'Some education leaders, such as Yong Zhao and Sir Ken Robinson, say it is time for schools to move beyond test scores and standards and towards student-centered classrooms that develop the potential for greatness that lies within each child. Current cognitive and psychological sciences have discovered that the “science of greatness” is complex, involving talents, practice, passion, interest, and hard work. But it is also finding that greatness and extraordinary abilities are within the reach of all of us. Discover what research on prodigies, savants, and geniuses teaches us about child potential and the links between learning disorders, great talents, and genius. Learn strategies to unlock your students’ potential, passions and interests, talents, creativity, expertise, and extraordinary performance.'
