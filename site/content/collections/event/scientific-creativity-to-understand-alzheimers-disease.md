list_description: 'This is an international conference directed to the medical community, scientists, and people concerned with Alzheimer''s disease (AD). The major theme is to explore cutting-edge research advances on this disease. AD is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease, currently the principal cause of dementia in the elderly, characterized by a progressive cognitive impairment, associated to the neuroinflammatory process triggered by “damage signals.” Considering the multifactorial scenario in this pathology, currently no drugs are available as an effective therapy against AD. This Conference will present some of the most creative developments in our understanding of how neuroinflammation triggers AD, as well as innovative biomarkers as a diagnosis tool and novel therapeutic avenues. The emergency of natural bioactive compounds appears as a plausible avenue toward prevention and as co-adjuvants in the treatment of this disease. In this context, evidence-based nutraceutical compounds rely on some of the major advances in molecular genetics, epitranscriptomics, molecular biology, and modern pharmacology.'
